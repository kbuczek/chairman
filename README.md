Chairman was created to help organize conferences.

Chairman mobile app (made in React Native) was designed to be used by so called "chairmans". They are designated to one speific room and are responsible to keep everything in sync with the conference schedule. Mobile app lets users add lectures to specific room. It lets chairmans lengthen the lecture or swap it with other lecture. It sends notifications to the user in order to remind him to start or finish the lecture. You can test the app on a android device, by downloading and installing "chairman-app.apk" from this repository.

Chairman frontend was created for attendants of the conference. On the webpage users can only browse conferences and filter lectures via days and rooms.

Chairman backend stores all conferences and lectures in MongoDB Atlas. Used Node.js as simple API for the React Native App and React frontend Webpage
